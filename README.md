# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-With-Python
This project's primary aim is to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on a dataset containing customer information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The objective is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.

By utilizing K-Means clustering, we've effectively divided the data into distinct subgroups, each defined by various features. This segmentation enables the mall management to focus their efforts on specific clusters with an average spending score, aiming to maximize overall profitability.

Furthermore, it's crucial to foster strong relationships with high-spending customers, who are considered premium patrons. Lastly, the mall's management must actively brainstorm and innovate to develop new strategies for encouraging and boosting the purchasing tendencies of customers with relatively low spending scores.


The dataset used in this project is **Mall_Customers.csv**.
It contains 200 rows and 5 columns:

* **CustomerID**: a unique ID assigned to the customer.

* **Gender**: gender of the customer (male or female).

* **Age**: age of the customer.

* **Annual Income(k$)**: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
  
* **Spending Score(1-100)**: score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.
